        <h2>Participate</h2>
        <a>There will be many students completing a research problem for consideration by the national selection committee.  
                Our goal is to select the five students with the best research.  However, we cannot select 5 students who have completed the same problem,
                so selection to the US team will be a combination of the quality of the research and ensuring problem coverage.</a>
        <!-- Step 1 (this block explains requirement #1) -->
    <div class="Block-1">
        <h1>1.</h1>
        <p> Complete at least 1 problem by Friday, March 13 2026. 
             To submit your solution, students will provide a static 
             PDF copy of their slides and a 12-minute recording presenting the slides.</p>
    </div>
        <!-- Step 2 (this block explains requirement #2) -->
    <div class="Block-2">
        <h1>2.</h1>
        <p>The submitted problems will be evaluated by independent reviewers who are 
            experts in physics (college professors, former IYPT jurors etc) </p>
    </div>
        <!-- Step 3 (this block explains requirement #3) -->
    <div class="Block-3">
        <h1>3.</h1>
        <p>A subset of the submitted reports will be selected for a round two interview. 
            Interviews will be conducted before the end of March, when the final team will be announced.</p>

        <!-- Step 4 (this block explains requirement #4) -->
    <div class="Block-4">
        <h1>4.</h1>
        <p>Team members will then need to complete an additional problem prior to the tournament in July.</p>

    <div class="Block-5">
        <h1>5.</h1>
        <p>Applicants may work individually or as a team of students.  However, only one student can submit the work for a problem.</p>

            <h1>Student Support with research</h1>
            <p>When requested, we will arrange video conference calls with subject matter experts to help you with your work. 
                 When requested, we can facilitate finding academic research.  We can provide guidance on experimental design and data analysis. 
                  Please, just ask.</p>

        <div class="s-Block-3">
            <h1>Cost of Participation</h1>
            <p>We are currently aggressively fundraising for Team USA 2026.  Worst case scenario is that we fundraise $0 dollars and the estimated cost would be $4000 per student.  However, we expect that not to be the case.  We have several corporations that have indicated they will support our mission; we are waiting for confirmation. 
                 When you indicate an interest in participation, we will keep you apprised of our fundraising efforts.</p>

            <p>Below is what we hope travel expectations will be.  However, this is right around the 250-year anniversary of birth of our country in Philadelphia.  We will need to be flexible here.</p>
            <li><u>Travel Dates:</u> Arrive in Philly June 30th for a pre-tournament "bootcamp".  Fly out together on July 3rd to Zurich.</li>
            <li><u>Tournament Dates:</u> July 5th-July 12</li>
            <li><u>Return to Philadelphia:</u> July 12, 2025</li>
